`test-casing` is a minimalistic Rust framework for generating tests for a given set of test cases
and decorating them to add retries, timeouts, sequential test processing etc.
In other words, the framework implements:

- Parameterized tests of reasonably low cardinality for the standard Rust test runner
- Fully code-based, composable and extensible test decorators.

## Contents

- [`lib`](lib): The main crate
- [`macro`](macro): Proc macros supporting the main crate.
